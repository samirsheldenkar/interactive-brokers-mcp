A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides integration with Interactive
Brokers' trading platform. This server allows AI assistants to interact with
your IB account to retrieve market data, check positions, and place trades.

## Features

- **Interactive Brokers API Integration**: Full trading capabilities including account management, position tracking, real-time market data, and order management (market, limit, and stop orders)
- **Flexible Authentication**: Choose between browser-based OAuth authentication or headless mode with credentials for automated environments
- **Simple Setup**: Run directly with `npx` - no Docker or additional installations required. Includes pre-configured IB Gateway and Java runtime for all platforms

## Security Notice

**IMPORTANT WARNINGS:**

- **Financial Risk**: Trading involves substantial risk of loss. Always test
  with paper trading first.
- **Security**: This software handles sensitive financial data. Only run
  locally, never on public servers.
- **No Warranty**: This unofficial software comes with no warranties. Use at
  your own risk.
- **Not Financial Advice**: This tool is for automation only, not financial
  advice.

## Prerequisites

**No additional installations required!** This package includes:

- Pre-configured IB Gateway for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for IB Gateway
- All necessary dependencies

You only need:

- Interactive Brokers account (paper or live trading)
- Node.js 18+ (for running the MCP server)

## Quick Start

Add this MCP server to your Cursor/Claude configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

When you first use the server, a web browser window will automatically open for
the Interactive Brokers OAuth authentication flow. Log in with your IB
credentials to authorize the connection.

## Headless Mode Configuration

For automated environments or when you prefer not to use a browser for
authentication, you can enable headless mode by configuring it in your MCP
server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IB_HEADLESS_MODE": "true",
        "IB_USERNAME": "your_ib_username",
        "IB_PASSWORD_AUTH": "your_ib_password"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

In headless mode, the server will automatically authenticate using your
credentials without opening a browser window. This is useful for:

- Automated trading systems
- Server environments without a display
- CI/CD pipelines
- Situations where browser interaction is not desired

**Important**: Even in headless mode, Interactive Brokers may still require
two-factor authentication (2FA). When 2FA is triggered, the headless
authentication will wait for you to complete the 2FA process through your
configured method (mobile app, SMS, etc.) before proceeding.

To enable paper trading, add `"IB_PAPER_TRADING": "true"` to your environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IB_HEADLESS_MODE": "true",
        "IB_USERNAME": "your_ib_username",
        "IB_PASSWORD_AUTH": "your_ib_password",
        "IB_PAPER_TRADING": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Note**: Store credentials securely and never commit them to version
control. Consider using environment variable files or secure credential
management systems.
