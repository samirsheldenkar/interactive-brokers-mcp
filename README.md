## Security Notice

**IMPORTANT WARNINGS:**

- **Financial Risk**: Trading involves substantial risk of loss. Always test
  with paper trading first.
- **Security**: This software handles sensitive financial data. Only run
  locally, never on public servers.
- **No Warranty**: This unofficial software comes with no warranties. Use at
  your own risk.
- **Not Financial Advice**: This tool is for automation only, not financial
  advice.

## Prerequisites

**No additional installations required!** This package includes:

- Pre-configured IB Gateway for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for IB Gateway
- All necessary dependencies

You only need:

- Interactive Brokers account (paper or live trading)
- Node.js 18+ (for running the MCP server)

## Quick Start

Add this MCP server to your Cursor/Claude configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

When you first use the server, a web browser window will automatically open for
the Interactive Brokers OAuth authentication flow. Log in with your IB
credentials to authorize the connection.

## Headless Mode Configuration

For automated environments or when you prefer not to use a browser for
authentication, you can enable headless mode by configuring it in your MCP
server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IB_HEADLESS_MODE": "true",
        "IB_USERNAME": "your_ib_username",
        "IB_PASSWORD_AUTH": "your_ib_password"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

In headless mode, the server will automatically authenticate using your
credentials without opening a browser window. This is useful for:

- Automated trading systems
- Server environments without a display
- CI/CD pipelines
- Situations where browser interaction is not desired

**Important**: Even in headless mode, Interactive Brokers may still require
two-factor authentication (2FA). When 2FA is triggered, the headless
authentication will wait for you to complete the 2FA process through your
configured method (mobile app, SMS, etc.) before proceeding.

To enable paper trading, add `"IB_PAPER_TRADING": "true"` to your environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IB_HEADLESS_MODE": "true",
        "IB_USERNAME": "your_ib_username",
        "IB_PASSWORD_AUTH": "your_ib_password",
        "IB_PAPER_TRADING": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Note**: Store credentials securely and never commit them to version
control. Consider using environment variable files or secure credential
management systems.

## Flex Query Configuration (Optional)

To use Flex Queries for retrieving account statements and historical data, you need to configure your Flex Web Service Token:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-brokers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "interactive-brokers-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IB_FLEX_TOKEN": "your_flex_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How to Get Your Flex Token:

1. Log in to [Interactive Brokers Account Management](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/portal)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Account Settings**
3. Navigate to **Reporting** → **Flex Web Service**
4. Generate or retrieve your Flex Web Service Token

For detailed instructions on enabling Flex Web Service, see the [IB Flex Web Service Guide](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/performanceandstatements/flex-web-service.htm).

### Creating Flex Queries:

1. Go to **Reports** → **Flex Queries** in Account Management
2. Create or customize your query template
3. Click the info icon next to your query to find its Query ID

For a complete guide on creating and customizing Flex Queries, see the [IB Flex Queries Guide](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/performanceandstatements/flex.htm).

**Note**: When you execute a Flex Query for the first time, the MCP server automatically saves it with its name from the API. Future executions can reference the query by either its ID or its saved name.

### Flex Query Features:

- **Automatic Memory**: When you execute a Flex Query, it's automatically saved for future use
- **Easy Reuse**: Previously used queries are remembered - no need to copy query IDs repeatedly
- **Friendly Names**: Optionally provide a friendly name when first executing a query
- **Forget Queries**: Remove queries you no longer need with the `forget_flex_query` tool
